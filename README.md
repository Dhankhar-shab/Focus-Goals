## 🌱 Why This Project Is Open Source

This app works.  
But it is **not finished**.

It is open-sourced because:

> **Good systems improve when thoughtful people challenge them.**

This repository is an invitation to:

- Improve the UI  
- Refine the psychology  
- Optimize performance  
- Add features *only if they respect the core philosophy*  

---

## ⚠️ A Challenge to Developers

If you contribute to this project, ask yourself:

- Does this change make the app calmer or noisier?  
- Does it reduce cognitive load?  
- Would you want to use this every day?  

If the answer is **no**, rethink the change.

This is **not a feature-dump project**.  
This is a **design discipline project**.

## 🧩 How to Contribute

You are encouraged to:

- Fork the repository  
- Improve any part (UI, logic, architecture, UX)  
- Create a meaningful update  
- Tag your version clearly  
- Open a pull request with **clear reasoning**  

Contributions that respect the app’s philosophy will always be valued.

---

## 🔖 Versioning & Evolution

Every meaningful improvement should:

- Be documented  
- Be tagged  
- Explain **why** the change exists, not just **what** changed  

This app is meant to **evolve thoughtfully**, not rapidly.

---

## 🧘 Final Note

Study Focus is not trying to compete with productivity giants.  
It is trying to serve a smaller group of people who value:

- **Depth over noise**  
- **Consistency over hype**  
- **Calm over chaos**
